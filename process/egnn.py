        Forward pass through the EGNN.

        The forward pass performs the following:
        1. Embeds the input node features.
        2. Passes the node features and coordinates through each E_GCL layer.
        3. Outputs the final transformed node features and updated coordinates.

        :param h: Node features (e.g., atom types)
        :param x: Node coordinates (e.g., 3D positions of atoms in the protein-ligand complex)
        :param edges: Defines which nodes are connected by edges (i.e., the graph structure)
        :param edge_attr: Edge features (e.g., bond types, bond lengths)
        :return: Updated node features and updated node coordinates
        """

        # Step 1: Embed the input node features into the hidden feature size
        h = self.embedding_in(h)

        # Step 2: Pass through each GCL layer, updating the node features and coordinates.
        # Each layer updates both the features (h) and positions (x) by using the connectivity and edge features.
        for i in range(self.n_layers):
            h, x, _ = self._modules["gcl_%d" % i](h, edges, x, edge_attr=edge_attr)

        # Step 3: Project the hidden node features to the output size using the final embedding layer
        h = self.embedding_out(h)

        # Return the updated node features and coordinates
        return h, x
